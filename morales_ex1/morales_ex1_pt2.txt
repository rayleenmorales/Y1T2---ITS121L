		<p><b> Benedicto Cabrera </b>, better known as BenCab, is considered the preeminent Filipino painter of his generation. Primarily figurative, Cabrera’s work often depicts woman and occasionally men wrapped in swirling, bundled fabrics and capes. He was born on April 10, 1942 in Malabon, Philippines, and studied at the University of the Phillippines. In 1963, he won first prize for his oil painting of a talipapa, or market, in a student competition, and was hired soon after by the national paper as its Sunday illustrator. Cabrera’s first exhibition of oil and acrylic paintings was held at the Indigo Gallery in Mabini in 1965, and has since shown work in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Tokyo, and notably London, where has lived on and off for much of his professional career. In 2006, the Philippine Government conferred upon him the Order of National Artist for Visual Arts. </p>

			<li> 1964 </li>
